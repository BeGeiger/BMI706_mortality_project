The goal of our project is to gain insights from state- and county-level visualizations of US mortality data.
The ranges from 1968 to 2016 and is stratified by state, (county), year, race, gender, age group and ICD code groups.

Please read the `README_data_generation.md` file in `data_generation` for further details on the data.
